# Financial Tools Suite

The goal of this toolkit is to streamline the process for viewing and interacting with all things finance-related. Currently, the primary tools available are for budget tracking and tax estimation.

These tools use macros and manual functions within Excel to process data. It is not clear how functionality will be affected by the file to different versions of Excel or even trying to share it through a cloud network.




# Budget Tracker

This set of tools lets you view and interact with your transactions. With it, you can see how your income and expenses are are categorized as well as how much is being allocated to each category.

**Dependencies**
- `BudgetTracker.xlsm`
    - `\Outputs`
- `SortTransactions.py`
    - `\ClassificationData`
    - `\Statements`

## Future Plans

### 1. Incorporate all financial accounts

- [x] Organize statements into unique folders
- [x] Search all folders for file corresponding to the input month and year
- [x] Consolidate CSV format for files from all financial sources, then merge into a data frame for processing

### 2. Update classification profile

- [x] Update json file names so they are all preceded by `income_` or `expenses_`
